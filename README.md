        ⦿ People can perceive body and gesture based communication without any problem. This is conceivable because of the mix of vision
    what's more, synaptic collaborations that were formed along mental health . To recreate this ability in PCs,
    a few issues should be tackled: how to isolate objects of interest in pictures and which picture catch innovation and
    arrangement strategy are more proper, among others.

        ⦿ In this task Motion based Work area computerization ,First the model is prepared pre prepared on the pictures of various
    hand signals, for example, an appearance numbers with fingers as 1 ,2,3,4 . This model purposes the incorporated webcam to catch the video
    outline. The picture of the signal caught in the video outline is contrasted and the Pre-prepared model and the motion is recognized.
    On the off chance that the motion predictes is 1, pictures is blurred;2, picture is resized;3,image is rotatedm and so forth.

**By the end of this project you will**

    ➼ Know fundamental concepts and techniques of Convolutional Neural Network.

    ➼ Gain a broad understanding of image data.

    ➼ Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data preprocessing techniques.

    ➼ Know how to build a web application using Flask framework.

       ⦿ In this project we have used Convolutional Neural Network to frst train the model on the images of
      different hand gestures, like showing numbers with fngers as 0,1,2,3,4,5. Then we made a web portal
      using Flask where user can input any image on which he wants to perform the operations. After
      uploading the image, our portal uses the integrated webcam to capture the video frame using
      OpenCV. The gesture captured in the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the
      gesture is identifed. If the prediction is 0 - then images is converted into rectangle, 1 - image is blurred
      , 2 - image is rotated by -45॰, 3 - image is resized in (400,400) , 4 - image is Resized in (200,200)  , 5 -
      image is converted into grayscale, but in real time we use of doctor-computer interaction devices in
      the operation room (OR) requires new modalities that support medical imaging manipulation while
      allowing doctors' hands to remain sterile, supporting their focus of attention, and providing fast
      response times.
